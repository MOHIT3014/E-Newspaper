    time: "5 Jun - 2022",
    desct: "Renewable energy continues to show remarkable advancements in technology, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, positioning itself as a key player in the global energy transition. Innovations in solar, wind, and battery storage systems have significantly improved energy generation, making it increasingly competitive with traditional fossil fuels. For instance, solar power costs have dropped by nearly 90% over the past decade, while wind power is also seeing similar cost reductions, driven by larger, more efficient turbines. Moreover, advancements in energy storage are addressing the intermittency issues of renewable sources, making it easier to store and distribute renewable energy as needed.Despite these technological strides, the renewable energy industry is still awaiting comprehensive policy support to unlock its full potential. Policymakers are lagging in implementing consistent regulations and incentives, such as tax credits and renewable energy mandates, which are critical for accelerating the transition to clean energy. Many companies in the industry are poised for rapid growth, but they face uncertainties due to inconsistent government support. For example, the delay in passing long-term climate and energy policies in some countries has slowed down investment, leaving industries in a wait-and-see mode.The growing public demand for sustainable energy and the urgent need to address climate change underscore the importance of swift policy action. Governments must align with global climate goals and provide the necessary policy frameworks to ensure a smooth and accelerated transition to a renewable energy future. Without this, the industry will face unnecessary obstacles, potentially slowing progress that is critical to mitigating climate impacts.",
